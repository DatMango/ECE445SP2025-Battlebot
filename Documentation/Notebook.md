For weekly entries of what occurred in design.

Our weekly meetings with our TA, Bill Yang, were on Mondays 6-6:30PM.

# Week of Jan 20
The beginning of the school year, formed group of: Justin, Yuxuan, and Zilong. This was the week of the Initial Web Board Post. Also when we decided on the idea of partaking in the Antweight, 3D Printed Battlebot competition hosted by Professor Gruev.

# Week of Jan 27
Our group solidifed of taking the Antweight Battlebot competition, and created our Early Project Approval to turn in 1/29. Everyone worked together to make sure to include the necessary details for the Early Project Approval. Also the week of the CAD assignment.

# Week of Feb 3
After third class meeting, we confirmed together that we were working on the Antweight Battlebot. Also were confirmed to be the first group to be approved - hence became Group 1. We began working together on the Project Proposal.

# Week of Feb 10
This week contained our first meeting with our TA (Bill). Beforehand, we as a team had prepared and worked on a first draft of our Block Diagram, three High-Level Requirements, and one Subsystem Requirement from our worked on Project Proposal. We had seeked feedback from Bill upon our project and got some guidance in the right direction on how to develop a Pneumatic system. We also sought advice on if we were in the right direction for our Project Proposal. This was also the week we turned in our [Project Proposal](Project%20Proposal.pdf) as well as our [Team Contract](Team%20Contract.pdf). Finally, we made sure that our Project Proposal was ready for the Proposal Review.

# Week of Feb 17
No weekly meeting with Bill this week. There would be a Design Review of our Project Proposal. Design Review would take place on 2/19 11AM. I believe there was an update to our high level block diagram a day before the review due to some missing parts.
### Tasks
- Everyone focuses on making sure [Project Proposal](Project%20Proposal.pdf) was ready for the Project Proposal / Design Review.
