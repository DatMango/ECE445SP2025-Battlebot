## Problem
The issue at hand is an Ant-weight, 3D Printed Battlebot Competition in which each team wants to win. There are certain constraints of the Battlebots’ design in order to be eligible and win. To win the competition, the goal of a battlebot is to outlast or destroy the opponent team’s battlebot. Different teams will have different designs, meaning a battlebot designed for winning must take into account as many factors to withstand and outlast the competition.

## Solution
We decided upon developing a 3D Printed Bluetooth-controlled battle bot powered by an ESP32 microcontroller. The Battlebot communicates with a PC via a Bluetooth module, enabling wireless command and control. It is equipped with two DC motors driven by H-bridge circuits for precise movement and a ramp-shaped weapon system for engaging in battles. The ESP32 manages motor control using GPIO and PWM, while the weapon system utilizes GPIO. The bot integrates real-time communication, robust motor control, and weapon functionality, offering an engaging and functional design. My goal is to create a responsive and competitive robot for dynamic competitions.
